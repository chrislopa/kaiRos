  <h1>Kairos Cognitive Care Brief Summary</h1>
  <p>
      Kairos Cognitive Care provides intense, in-context coaching which over time is expected to teach a client healthy coping skills
      and life-management behaviours. The preferred outcome from this treatment is a significant, preferably permanent change in thought
      patterns, reactivity, and outward behaviour although some severe, prolonged disorders may require life-long coaching support due to
      impaired or damaged executive function. <br>
    <br><hr>
      The second critical component of Kairos is its innovative onboarding procedure. Personalized, casual interviews are designed to put
      the client at ease, adapting to shortened attention spans, impaired memory, and skewed perceptions of reality while at the same time
      gathering the most comprehensive clinical mental health interview data matrix currently in use anywhere in Canada. Using a specific
      combination of University-validated cross-cut assessments, Kairos has a more accurate picture of the clientâ€™s actual investigative
      needs after only 2-3 ninety minute sessions conducted within ten days of intake. <br>
    <br><hr>
      Since June 2016, we have seen between 67 and 99 percent improvement in care outcomes for 87% of our patients although the sample is
      currently extremely small. Wait times to see psychiatrists have gone from the standard 12 months to six weeks through Kairos.
      Wait times for specialized neurologists such as migraine and chronic pain have gone from three years to six months. Recovery times
      for those suffering from confirmed mental health conditions have been reduced from a span of 12 to 18 months to only six months.
      On the high end, complex cases could take eight to ten years to reach full recovery. We are seeing these cases reach satisfactory
      stability within two to two and a half years. Exit from our program maintains periodic revisits with a coach to affirm continuity
      of behaviour changes. In other programs, these revisits would have been much more costly, being done by psychologists or psychiatrists
      at nearly triple the price. Post program adherence to behaviour change is more likely with our program than with other supports currently
      available because of the lower cost of follow-up care, pre-established coach-client relationship making client outreach less intimidating,
      and our increased likelihood of applying correct treatment to correct diagnosis.
